                    <p class="ml-2 text-light">Hello! As you can tell, my name is Matthew Bishop. I am a current student
                        at the KU Coding Bootcamp.
                        I have had 0 prior knowlege of coding and I'm very excited for what I am about to learn.
                        I went to a tech school back in 2015 and got my A+ certification along with my Networking and
                        Security certifications(they are expired now).
                        I have a cat named Yooka and 2 dogs named Banjo and Kazooie
                        (based
                        off of the video game Banjo and Kazooie). I enjoy muscle cars and I currently own a 2011 Mustang
                        GT. I used to
                        own a motorcycle, but I was unable to take it with me when I moved from Utah to Missouri. My favorite
                        genre of music is Metal/Heavy Metal. My favorite band is Slipknot.
                        I was born and raised in St. George Utah, I moved to Parowan Utah when I was 8 years old. We
                        stayed there for 7
                        years which was 3 and a half years longer than we planned. Turns out it's kind of hard to move
                        out of small towns that are far away
                        from fast food places and grocery stores. After that we moved back to St. George for about 2
                        years. Then moved up to northern Utah to Springville.
                        We only lived there for about a year and a half before moving to Tooele, which is a town about a
                        hour north of Springville. Once again we only stayed there
                        for about 2 years before moving back to St. George and building our own house. Long and boring
                        story short we moved a couple more times before I was sick of it.
                        I found my lovely wife online playing the game Overwatch and one thing led to another and she
                        moved me out to Blue Springs Missouri to live with her before we eventually got married.
                        I've been working as a Quality Control Auditor for the past 2 years for gas companies across the
                        nation. I am very excited to start my new carreer as a Web Developer and can't wait
                        to learn all the new skills that this course teaches.
