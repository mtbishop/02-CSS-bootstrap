                        Bootcamp.
                        I have had 0 prior knowlege of coding and I'm very excited for what I am about to learn.
                        I went to a tech school back in 2015 and got my A+ certification along with my Networking and
                        Security certifications(they areew Bishop. I am a current student at the KU expired now).
                        I have 1 cat and 2 dogs. The cats name is Yooka and the 2 dogs are named Banjo and Kazooie
                        (based
                        off of the video game Banjo and Kazooie). I enjoy muscle cars! I currently own a 2011 Mustang
                        GT. I
                        use to
                        own a motorcycle. I was unable to take it with me when I moved from Utah to Missouri. My
                        favorite
